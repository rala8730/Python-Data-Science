I used the given formula from the slides to finish all of the homework. I had error in my degreeof freedom and t-statics  because i squared the unbiased sample variance. 
here is the formula that i have used.


Degree of freedom

t-test


    p=2*(1.0-t.cdf(abs(t_stastics),degree_of_freedom))
	

chisquare_pvalue


used the chi square function and  ignored the first value so i could return chi value only

created a counter and set it up so that if key exist then count if not its null. and if the value is greater than append.
