# Rules

Pull requests should contain fixes to skeleton code and not provide a solution. If you are a CU Boulder student, be warned that it is an honor code violation to publicly post your code in a way that other students might use it to cheat from.

We will immediately close pull requests with:

1. No comments indicating what changes have been made and why.
2. What looks like in any way solution code. This is a homework skeleton repository, not a solutions repository
